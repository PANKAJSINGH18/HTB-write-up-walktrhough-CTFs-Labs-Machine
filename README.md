# HTB-write-up-walktrhough-CTFs-Labs-Machine

The history of creation of this repository is pretty funny, i was a normal user of HTB, trying to follow their rules, i usually used to create my own write-ups but those remain private because i wanted to follow terms of use of HTB.
One day, my account was banned i asked for help to their support and they say that i was breaking their rules just for be part of their forums and because to be part of a team, today i open a new free learning walk giving up every tangible progress cuantification, my purpose is to help new people to understand ethical hacking techniques. Enjoy the content this repo will be uploaded weekly.
